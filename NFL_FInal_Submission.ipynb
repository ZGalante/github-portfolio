    "Consisting of 5 players, the offensive line plays a critical part in the success of a team. During every play, each linemen must understand his assignment and be able to work in unison with the rest of the line. This analysis will focus on the performance of the entire offensive line as a whole during pass plays throughout the first 8 weeks of the 2021 NFL season. This will be done by constructing a metric using both existing and created features. "

    "## Methodology \n",
    "To create our metric, we first trained a logistic regression model to predict if a play would contain an 'event of interest', which were plays where at least one of the 5 offensive linemen were marked as allowing one of the following; <i>'pff_hurryAllowed', 'pff_hitAllowed', 'pff_sackAllowed' </I>. Our best performing logistic regression model resulted in an accuracy score of 0.72, with a balanced accuracy score of 0.68. We then took the coefficients and bias term from this model to use in our metric to asses offensive line perfomance."
